Code Review (Ass 1)
In this project, we developed a Python module focused on code correctness and best practices. The implementation demonstrates proficiency in writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code. The project includes a comprehensive README that outlines the solution approach, usage instructions, and key considerations for maintainability and scalability. This assignment highlights attention to detail in code structure and documentation.

Inventory Management System (Ass 2)
This project involved building a robust inventory management system using Django and Flask frameworks. The solution features modular application design, including custom authentication, permissions, and middleware for enhanced security and flexibility. We containerized the application using Docker and managed multi-service orchestration with Docker Compose, ensuring seamless development and deployment workflows. The system integrates PostgreSQL for persistent data storage and includes automated scripts for database backup and environment setup. Additional components such as RESTful APIs, custom management commands, and CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions) were implemented to support scalability, reliability, and maintainability. Comprehensive documentation and configuration files were provided to facilitate onboarding and operational efficiency.
